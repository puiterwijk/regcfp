Update on your GUADEC talk

Hello,

Thank you for submitting a talk for GUADEC 2017. We have had a lot of excellent
submissions this year, with strong competition for the available slots.
Unfortunately, we were not able to accept your talk, "{{paper.title}}", but we
hope to still see you in Manchester!

You can find more information about getting to Manchester at
